% \fillwithlines takes one argument, which is either a length or \fill
% or \stretch{number}, and it fills that much vertical space with
% horizontal lines that run the length of the current line.  That is,
% they extend from the current left margin (which depends on whether
% we're in a question, part, subpart, or subsubpart) to the right
% margin.
%
% The distance between the lines is \linefillheight, whose default value
% is set with the command
%
% \setlength\linefillheight{.25in}
%
% This value can be changed by giving a new \setlength command.
%
% The thickness of the lines is \linefillthickness, whose default value
% is set with the command
%
% \setlength\linefillthickness{.1pt}
%
% This value can be changed by giving a new \setlength command.

%                            \fillwithgrid


% \fillwithgrid is similar to \fillwithlines, except that it
% fills the space with a grid.

% \fillwithgrid takes one argument, which is either a length or \fill
% or \stretch{number}, and it fills that much vertical space with a
% grid that runs the length of the current line.  That is, it extends
% from the current left margin (which depends on whether we're in a
% question, part, subpart, or subsubpart) to the right margin.
%
% The default grid size and grid line thickness were set by the
% commands
%
% \setlength{\gridsize}{5mm}
% \setlength{\gridlinewidth}{0.1pt}
%
% You can change either or both of those by giving new \setlength
% commands.  The period of the grid is \gridsize (both horizontally
% and vertically).  That is, the horizontal distance from the left
% edge of one vertical line to the left edge of the next vertical line
% is \gridsize, as is the vertical distance from the top edge of one
% horizontal line to the top edge of the next horizontal line.  Thus,
% each square has outer side length equal to \gridsize+\gridlinewidth.

% By default, the created grids are in black.  However, if you give the
% commands
%
% \usepackage{color}
% \colorgrids
%
% then the grids will be in color, by default a light gray.  That
% default color was defined by the command
%
% \definecolor{GridColor}{gray}{0.8}
%
% You can change the color by redefining the color GridColor by giving
% a new \definecolor command.
